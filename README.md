# Python 101 and Intro to pandas/numpy

The aim for this document is to give a whirlwind tour of Python and Useful Data Science libraries for people new to Python. The aim is not to cover everything, but just introduce a few relevant topics and point to reasonably good resources and links to read up from.

**NOTE**: This is just a hastily written guide, and is not affiliated to CQF / Man Group or any of the links / courses in any way.


## Python Basics

It's quite easy (probably why these libs are so successful) to start using pandas / numpy and copy-paste boilerplate code without understanding the basics of the language itself. But before we can start delving into ML and other advanced DS stuff I think it's critical to at least understand these basic topics in Python:
1) Variables, constants and common data-types
2) Common data structures: lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries
3) Conditionals and loops: if/else and for
4) Functions: Custom defined ones and importing ones from the standard lib
5) Basic file parsing and error handling

Obviously Python is a vast topic and this only covers a subset but imo it should cover the relevant fundamentals before starting with DS 101.
I did glance a few courses for introductory python and

## DS 101

This section broadly covers the fundamentals of Numpy, Pandas and basics of plotting.

1) Numpy: Memory structure and useful modules
2) Pandas: Reading data, indexing, filtering, aggregating and working with bad data.
3) Plotting: basics and common libs
